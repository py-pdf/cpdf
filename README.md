# Python PDF Community Snippets

The PPCS (Python PDF Community Snippets) is a collection of Python code snippets
that show how to use Python to interact with PDF documents - reading, writing,
analyzing, and modifying. Whatever you can imagine.

This is NOT only limited to PyPDF2!

## Rules

1. Python Scripts that do something with PDF files only.
2. All scripts are under the BSD license. If you add a script you agree to that.
3. All scripts are self-contained. They don't use other scripts in the repository, but they are allowed to use PyPI packages
4. All scripts are at most 1000 lines long.
5. All scripts have a reasonable docstring that explains what the script is good for.
6. All scripts pass CI ([black formatting](https://pypi.org/project/black/), [mypy](https://pypi.org/project/mypy/), [flake8](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/)) - don't worry, we will help you with that one!
